# BMI Calculator

## This BMI Calculator is a command-line application written in JavaScript, which calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for height (in inches) and weight (in pounds). It then evaluates the BMI to determine the user's weight category, which can be underweight, healthy, overweight, or obese.
